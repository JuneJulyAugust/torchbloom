## Overview

The course begins with the theory of projections in inner product spaces. Students study norms, inner products, orthogonality, and orthogonal complements in vector spaces over the real and complex numbers. Techniques such as orthogonal projections, the Gram–Schmidt process, and QR factorization allow vectors to be decomposed into orthogonal components. These ideas play a role in Fourier analysis, signal decomposition, and numerical methods used in physical simulations. Students then explore quadratic forms and the diagonalization of symmetric matrices. The spectral theorem provides a geometric interpretation of symmetric transformations and leads to techniques for analyzing energy functions and stability in physical systems. Singular value decomposition is also introduced as a powerful matrix factorization with applications in numerical modeling and data analysis. Applications of linear algebra follow, including least-squares methods for solving overdetermined systems. These methods arise when fitting theoretical models to experimental data and when approximating solutions to physical equations. The course then develops multivariable integration in three dimensions. Students compute triple integrals over general regions and apply coordinate transformations such as cylindrical and spherical coordinates. These techniques allow physicists to compute quantities such as mass distributions, charge densities, and gravitational or electric potentials. Students next study line integrals and surface integrals of scalar and vector fields. Concepts such as circulation, flux, and path independence lead to the fundamental theorems of vector calculus, including Green’s theorem, the divergence theorem, and Stokes’ theorem. These results form the mathematical framework underlying conservation laws and the differential and integral formulations of electromagnetic theory. Applications of multivariable calculus follow, including vector mechanics and optimization. Students analyze motion using vector-valued functions, apply Newton’s second law to systems in the plane, and study work–energy relationships. Multiple integrals are used to compute mass, centers of mass, moments of inertia, and other physical quantities. The course then returns to differential equations, extending earlier techniques to systems of linear differential equations. Students analyze dynamical systems using eigenvalues, phase portraits, and matrix methods, which appear in models of interacting systems such as coupled oscillators or predator–prey dynamics. Laplace transforms are introduced as a powerful tool for solving linear differential equations with discontinuous inputs or initial conditions. Boundary value problems and Fourier series are then developed, providing mathematical techniques used to solve differential equations describing heat flow, vibrating strings, wave propagation, and other physical phenomena. The course concludes with numerical methods for differential equations and advanced probability topics. Students analyze the accuracy and stability of numerical schemes used in computational physics and study multivariate probability distributions and the central limit theorem, which appear in statistical physics and experimental analysis.
